# BotKit

This is the library used to build the chatbot in my (ElixirConf talk)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GorU5oEbf-c]

## Installation


```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:botkit, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

This library is not yet available on hex, so no documentation yet. For examples, take a look at (BotKit examples)[https://github.com/falmusha/botkit_example]
